# Simple AEMET weather API

This project has two objectives: the main one is to learn Typescript, NodeJS and Express and escape from my confort zone; the second one is to provide a wrapper to the AEMET's Opendata API that it is great but not so easy to integrate as it should be.

The project is starting so don't expect to have any functional block at the moment.
